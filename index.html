          I am dumb. I procrastinate too much. I eat too many snacks. I laugh at bad jokes. 
          Sometimes, I forget where I keep things. I binge-watch TV shows instead of studying. 
          I take too long to reply to texts. I’m overly sentimental. I can’t stop singing even 
          though my voice is bad. I get lost in daydreams. I’m overly critical of myself. I’m 
          clumsy and spill things often. I stay up too late and complain about being tired. I 
          overthink everything. I cry at movies, even the ones that aren’t sad. I’m not great at 
          cooking. I get easily distracted. I’m awkward in social situations. I forget names of 
          people I’ve just met. I try too hard to make everyone happy. I misplace my phone at 
          least once a day. I take way too many selfies. I have a bad habit of interrupting people 
          by accident. I’m terrible at math. I leave socks everywhere. I can’t stop eating 
          chocolate. I buy things I don’t need. I laugh at my own jokes. I talk to my pets like 
          they’re people. I always say, “Just one more episode” and then watch five more. I get 
          emotional when I see old photos. I’m bad at replying to emails. I sometimes forget 
          important dates. I talk too fast when I’m nervous. I’m stubborn about weird things. 
          I keep plants that I forget to water. I make bad puns. I eat cereal at night. I think 
          way too much about what other people think of me. I leave my shoes lying around. I 
          sing off-key in the shower. I’m afraid of spiders, even tiny ones. I never fold my 
          laundry properly. I eat all the snacks in the house and pretend I didn’t. I press the 
          snooze button too many times. I wear mismatched socks. I forget to charge my phone. 
          I’m terrible at directions. I always run out of shampoo. I take way too long to get 
          ready. I spill coffee on my clothes. I leave lights on when I leave a room. I’m bad 
          at remembering jokes. I overpack for trips. I buy too many books and don’t read them. 
          I talk during movies. I eat popcorn too loudly. I can’t decide what to order at a 
          restaurant. I lose my house keys too often. I take up too much space on the couch. 
          I never finish my to-do list. I skip workouts and regret it later. I try to fix things 
          I don’t understand. I forget to reply to messages for days. I keep too many tabs open 
          on my browser. I argue over silly things and realize it later. I eat ice cream too 
          fast and get a brain freeze. I tell bad jokes and laugh too hard at them.
