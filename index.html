          I am terrible at remembering names. I always forget where I put my headphones. 
          I accidentally set alarms for PM instead of AM. I leave my laptop charger behind 
          everywhere I go. I get too excited about small things. I don’t fold my clothes 
          properly. I leave books half-read. I overwater my plants. I always ask for “five 
          more minutes” when waking up. I leave the toothpaste cap off. I get too invested 
          in fictional characters. I’m bad at keeping track of my to-do list. I lose my 
          wallet too often. I crack my knuckles too much. I can’t resist buying gadgets I 
          don’t need. I hoard stationery. I accidentally put milk before cereal sometimes. 
          I zone out during conversations. I eat way too many snacks in one sitting. I’m 
          stubborn about picking the wrong route while driving. I always forget to clean my 
          microwave. I re-watch the same shows over and over again. I take forever to decide 
          on what to order at restaurants. I leave my phone on silent and forget about it. 
          I get distracted while cleaning and start something else. I never fully close 
          drawers or cupboards. I lose my socks after every wash. I have trouble figuring 
          out left from right in a rush. I sometimes skip meals and regret it later. I’m 
          terrible at keeping track of birthdays. I eat pizza with too much hot sauce. I 
          spend too much time deciding which movie to watch. I always carry too many things 
          in my pockets. I prefer late nights and hate waking up early. I leave my shoes 
          near the door instead of putting them away. I laugh way too hard at bad jokes. 
          I take too many detours on road trips. I write long messages and delete them 
          before sending. I have way too many tabs open in my browser at all times. I 
          always forget to refill the water bottle. I’m bad at multitasking and end up 
          doing nothing. I love spicy food but complain when it’s too spicy. I tell stories 
          that are longer than they need to be. I organize my workspace, only for it to get 
          messy again the next day. I talk to myself when I think no one’s listening. I 
          always forget the second verse of a song. I laugh at my own jokes, even when 
          they’re not funny. I take way too long to finish books. I stay up late researching 
          random facts I don’t need to know. I misplace my phone and then panic for hours. 
          I get too attached to inanimate objects like my favorite mug.
